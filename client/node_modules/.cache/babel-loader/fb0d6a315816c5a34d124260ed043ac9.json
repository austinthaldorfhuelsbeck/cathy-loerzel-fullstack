INTENSIVES</h1>\n        <br />\n        <p>Each of us have origin stories that shape how we operate in our day to day lives and without an understanding of these stories - they will subconsciously lead our lives. There are reasons we feel anxious, disconnected. depressed, sad or fearful and those reasons reside in your stories of childhood harm and heartache.</p>\n        <br />\n        <p>None of us can escape harm and we have all adjusted our ways of relating in order to negotiate the difference between what we were meant for and what we encounter. Each life can be understood and healed - we just have to be brave enough to listen to what our bodies know but our minds are catching up to.</p>\n        <br />\n        <p><em><strong>Storywork Intensives</strong></em> offer a space to intentionally deep dive into your stories of heartache and trauma. Engaging your stories will help us understand more of your family of origin and its link to where you are struggling to find freedom, joy and connection in the present.</p>\n        <br />\n        <p>The intensive format is intended to engage your core issues quickly, but is not intended to replace regular therapeutic engagement. Please ensure you have an after-care plan in place prior to the intensive.
