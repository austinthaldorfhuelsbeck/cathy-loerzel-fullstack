        <h1>STORYWORK INTENSIVES</h1>
        <br />
        <p>Each of us have origin stories that shape how we operate in our day to day lives and without an understanding of these stories - they will subconsciously lead our lives. There are reasons we feel anxious, disconnected. depressed, sad or fearful and those reasons reside in your stories of childhood harm and heartache.</p>
        <br />
        <p>None of us can escape harm and we have all adjusted our ways of relating in order to negotiate the difference between what we were meant for and what we encounter. Each life can be understood and healed - we just have to be brave enough to listen to what our bodies know but our minds are catching up to.</p>
        <br />
        <p><em><strong>Storywork Intensives</strong></em> offer a space to intentionally deep dive into your stories of heartache and trauma. Engaging your stories will help us understand more of your family of origin and its link to where you are struggling to find freedom, joy and connection in the present.</p>
        <br />
        <p>The intensive format is intended to engage your core issues quickly, but is not intended to replace regular therapeutic engagement. Please ensure you have an after-care plan in place prior to the intensive. If you are in need of a weekly therapist, please consult <a href="https://adamyoungcounseling.com/referral-list/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Adam Young's referral list</a> or <a href="https://theallendercenter.org/find-a-counselor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">The Allender Center's referral list</a>.</p>
        <br />
        <p>You are also welcome to sign-up for a coaching package after or before your intensive.</p>
        <br />
        <p>I offer three Intensive formats:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Individual Intensives</li>
          <li>Group Intensives</li>
          <li>Soul/Body Intensives</li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <h2>STORYWORK <em>GROUP</em> INTENSIVES</h2>
        <br />
        <p>Some of the most profound healing occurs in community. Storywork Group Intensives offer a chance to gather with other people and lean into our stories collectively as well as individually. Each person is invited to share one story and will receive engagement from me and the group.</p>
        <br />

        <h2>Storywork Individual Intensives:</h2>
        <br />
        <p>These intensives are designed to offer you one on one space to engage two stories with the gift of uninterrupted time. This will be a sacred time to focus into your past pain and begin to understand where you are stuck and how to heal from your past heartache.</p>
        <br />
        <p>We will meet in my office in Seattle. The fee for an intensive is $3,800 for individuals and $4,200 for couples. Half of the fee is required as a deposit to reserve your spot.</p>
        <br />
        <br />
        <p>An intensive is a significant investment so I offer a 30 minute video conference for us to decide if this is a good fit for you and where you are in your life. The video conference is complementary if you decide to sign up for an intensive.</p>
        <br />

        <h2>Storywork Body and Soul Intensives:</h2>
        <br />
        <p>These intensives are three days in Seattle and designed to combine story and body work with the remarkable Karen Ciruli of <a href="https://www.bodyofeden.rest/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Body of Eden.</a></p>
        <br />
        <p>We will do storywork, body sessions with Karen and end with a combined session together to help integrate the work.</p>
        <br />
        <p>This intensive will help us work with your whole body and help you integrate the places in your story and body that need coordinated care. Often our bodies are telling us a story we donâ€™t yet have words for and Karen is a skilled body practitioner who will listen to your body and help you connect to the unknown. That work, combined with the care of Storywork will help you heal and reconnect your body, soul and spirit.</p>
